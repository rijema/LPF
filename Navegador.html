<center> <h2> What's Kotlin? </h2>  </center>

    <p> Kotlin is a general purpose, open source, statically typed “pragmatic” programming language for the JVM and Android
    that combines object-oriented and functional programming features. It is focused on interoperability, safety, clarity,
    and tooling support. Versions of Kotlin for JavaScript (ECMAScript 5.1) and native code (using LLVM) are in the works.

    Kotlin originated at JetBrains, the company behind IntelliJ IDEA, in 2010, and has been open source since 2012. The Kotlin
    team currently has more than 20 full-time members from JetBrains, and the Kotlin project on GitHub has about 100 contributors.
        JetBrains uses Kotlin in many of its products including its flagship IntelliJ IDEA. </p>

    <center> <h2> Is Kotlin a FP lang?</h2> </center>

    When we think about Kotlin, OOP is always implicit. But that’s not strictly necessary. Kotlin is still open to a
    different paradigm thanks to some of its built-in features. I’m obviously referring to FP.

    Having the possibility to pass functions as function arguments, or return functions from other functions opens the
    language to new techniques like deferred computation. If you return functions on your different layers instead of
    already computed values, what you get back from it is a composed deferred computation, or in other words, lazy
    evaluation. Your computations are deferred in time, still not run.

    You can also stare at the language a bit longer, and you will be able to find tons of additional features that you can
    find on many type safe FP languages: Type inference, operator overloading, good support for syntax improvements
    (implemented by extension functions), collection operations as map, flatMap, fold, reduce…, or even algebraic data types
    (sealed classes).

    What a functional programing lang is, is not clearly defined and it depends on where you look at or which posts do you
    read. The boundaries for that could be a bit blurry. But honestly, that is not such important here. In the end, truth is
    Kotlin is kind of “enabling” this higher abstraction level paradigm just by adding some interesting built-in features.
    So if we wanted to achieve it, we could.
